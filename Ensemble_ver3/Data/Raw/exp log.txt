record your observation. not data analysis
whether they ask question? do they take the exp seriously?
what do they see when they report breaking?
can you trust their judgement?

can not see at first, then learn how to see and do the exp with 100% contrast

1702252
do at 8%

1702253 
do at 10% but right visual field never breaks

1702261
do with 7.5% mask but say he's not sure about what he see when he report breaking.
do the exp slowly and after 40% trials start to break and can not see the mask again.

1702262
ok subject

1702263
do at 15%. right visual field never break. doing fast, not asking much question.

I told him not to do classification task
in a rush after 80%  do the exp quickly in 40 min

1703012
do the experiment slowly, get water
said she can only can not close her left eye only
feels tired after 60% doing classification afterwards
some smiling face looks evil?

1703013
feel tire after 60%
Seems to be interested in this study

1703014
ask me to adjust the distance of the box to make sure it merge
doing fast, didn't take much break

1703015
restart at after doing 20% since he started to break in a row
tried to figure you what this study is about, means that he took it seriously?
he can tell form my instructions that the broken trials are useless trials
doing fast, doesn't seems to be tired? but i didn't ask QQ

1703021
do at 50% contrast
usually only see the eyes

1703051
do at 15% contrast
is not breaking in lower parts in the beginner and starts to break
